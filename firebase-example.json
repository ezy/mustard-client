There is such awe inspiring depth to these words that sometimes we forget that they are also equally profound taken at face value – kid’s matter.Within a child is a treasure waiting to flourish, waiting to dream, and waiting to grow. As a part of the Olive Tree Kid’s Church, it is not only our job to guide our future generation to encounter Jesus’ accepting love; it is also our honour to do so.  To be a part of a child’s encounters with who God, and Jesus is, is truly a blessing and an honour.  We can learn so much from kids, their brutal honesty and never ending joy and love, are attributes which mirror Jesus not only to us, but to their peers, their teachers, and their families.It is well known that big corporate companies target their advertising carefully to the times they know children will be watching television.  They understood that if they get the child’s attention, they would get the attention of the entire family.  Never underestimate the value and importance of children. Jesus didn’t and here at the Olive Tree Kids Church, we most certainly don’t either.</p>",

The ethos of the Olive Tree of keeping things simple and bringing things back to first principle extends to how we choose to worship God. The bible says that we should worship Him in spirit and in truth. How exactly do we do that?</p><p>Like most churches we recognise the power and the influence of music in our culture and this is a key medium through which we express our adoration to God (while also recognising that true worship encompasses so many more areas of our life).   That said we do not have a particular sound or way in which we would like to worship God.  We start again with the proverbial blank sheet of paper and begin to explore what it means to worship and how we can express ourselves creatively to God.</p><p>There are so many ways this can be done whether that is through traditional worship songs sung by the congregation, by video clips or items; by a large group of musicians or just one or two.</p><p><b>The point is not what it looks like, but the heart that is offered up to God and the spirit in which it is done: to worship God in spirit and in truth.</b></p>",

      "text" : "<p>On Sunday, we contemplated who God is and our logical response to this knowledge, of complete submission, dedication and reliance/trust. One Biblical example of this is found in the book of Daniel.</p><p>Daniel was a noble Jewish youth of Jerusalem, taken into captivity by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, serving him (and his successors) with loyalty. All the while, Daniel remained true to the God of Israel. He was a wise man in the king’s sight. We read that Nebuchadnezzar had a dream. He then not only asked his wise men to interpret the dream for him, but to also tell him what the dream was (he wouldn’t tell them). They were unable to do so and the king decreed that all wise men, including Daniel, were to be killed.</p><p>When Daniel inquired ‘with discretion and discernment’ as to why the wise men were to be killed, he asked that the king would give him the opportunity to meet the request. Daniel immediately called a prayer meeting (“…so that they might request compassion from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his friends would not be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.”). God then revealed to him both the dream and its interpretation that night in a vision. Whilst this is very cool indeed, the even cooler part was Daniel’s response to God:</p><p>Daniel said, “Let the name of God be blessed forever and ever, for wisdom and power belong to Him. It is He who changes the times and the epochs; He removes kings and establishes kings; He gives wisdom to wise men and knowledge to men of understanding. It is He who reveals the profound and hidden things; He knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with Him. To You, O God of my fathers, I give thanks and praise, for You have given me wisdom and power; even now You have made known to me what we requested of You, for You have made known to us the king’s matter.” (Daniel 2:20 – 23)</p><p>When the king asked Daniel if he was able to make known to him the dream and the interpretation, Daniel said to Him: “…neither wise men, conjurers, magicians, nor diviners are able to declare it to the king. However, there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and He has made known…” Daniel gave all glory to God; the super coolest part of all!</p><p>Blessings,<br>Wendy</p>",

    "text" : "<p>The journey for The Olive Tree Church began when three experienced leaders sat down and over coffee wondered aloud what they would do if they could do it all over again. What would they do the same; what would they do differently; what would theydo if they could start with the proverbial 'blank sheet of paper.' Their thoughts found a commonality of expression and soon other like minded people urged them to do something about it. And so the Olive Tree was born. It is not an attempt todo church the right way (as if there is only one way to love God and love others) just to do it a different way; to intentionally place the emphasis on the basics (original design).</p><p>Given that the Bible has little to say on the 'how' of doing church but a lot on the 'why' we are committed to living together as a church community based primarily on the first principles of scripture. This means that we place more value on people thanon performance or Church 'bling'. We want to keep church simple so that it fulfils its valuable contribution to a well lived Christian life but not at the expense of burning people out. We want to keep it real, which also means allowing peopleto be less than perfect and make mistakes. We want to practice servant leadership, firstly in the church but also in the world where we are consistently rising to the challenge of serving those Jesus describes as 'the least of these.' We don'twant people to come and build the church's vision but rather we want the church to equip and build people to live out their God given visions and dreams. We want to see the Kingdom of God developed in every aspect of where Christians live, notjust for a few hours on a Sunday morning or one night a week.</p><p>This is the journey we are committed to. This is the story we want to write. So what about you? What would you do if your life was a blank piece of paper and you could write what you wanted..?</p>",
