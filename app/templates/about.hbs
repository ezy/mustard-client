                  The journey for The Olive Tree Church began when three experienced leaders sat down and over coffee wondered aloud what they would do if they could do it all over again. What would they do the same; what would they do differently; what would they
                  do if they could start with the proverbial "blank sheet of paper." Their thoughts found a commonality of expression and soon other like minded people urged them to do something about it. And so the Olive Tree was born. It is not an attempt to
                  do church the right way (as if there is only one way to love God and love others) just to do it a different way; to intentionally place the emphasis on the basics (original design).

                  Given that the Bible has little to say on the "how" of doing church but a lot on the "why" we are committed to living together as a church community based primarily on the first principles of scripture. This means that we place more value on people than
                  on performance or Church "bling". We want to keep church simple so that it fulfils its valuable contribution to a well lived Christian life but not at the expense of burning people out. We want to keep it real, which also means allowing people
                  to be less than perfect and make mistakes. We want to practice servant leadership, firstly in the church but also in the world where we are consistently rising to the challenge of serving those Jesus describes as “the least of these.” We don't
                  want people to come and build the church's vision but rather we want the church to equip and build people to live out their God given visions and dreams. We want to see the Kingdom of God developed in every aspect of where Christians live, not
                  just for a few hours on a Sunday morning or one night a week.

                  This is the journey we are committed to. This is the story we want to write. So what about you? What would you do if your life was a blank piece of paper and you could write what you wanted....?
