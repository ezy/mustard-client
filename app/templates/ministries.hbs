        <h3>Boundaries</h3>
        <p>
          Boundaries are personal property lines that define who you are and who you are not, and influence all areas of your life. They enable you to say "Yes" when you mean "Yes" and "No" when you mean "No."
        </p>
        <p>
          PHYSICAL Boundaries help you determine who may touch you and under what circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          MENTAL Boundaries give you the freedom to have your own thoughts and opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
          EMOTIONAL Boundaries help you deal with your own emotions and disengage from the harmful, manipulative emotions of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          We run the Boundaries Course at The Olive Tree from time to time. Check with Adria on adria.lg246@gmail.com for the next course.

        <h3>Olive Tree Children's Church</h3>
        <p>
          Everyone, at some stage of their Christian walk, would have read the words of Jesus, found in the book of Matthew in chapter 19, verse 14: Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such
          as these." There is such awe inspiring depth to these words that sometimes we forget that they are also equally profound taken at face value – kid’s matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within a child is a treasure waiting to flourish, waiting to dream, and waiting to grow. As a part of the Olive Tree Kid’s Church, it is not only our job to guide our future generation to encounter Jesus’ accepting love; it is also our honour to do so.
          To be a part of a child’s encounters with who God, and Jesus is, is truly a blessing and an honour. We can learn so much from kids, their brutal honesty and never ending joy and love, are attributes which mirror Jesus not only to us, but to
          their peers, their teachers, and their families.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is well known that big corporate companies target their advertising carefully to the times they know children will be watching television. They understood that if they get the child’s attention, they would get the attention of the entire family. Never
          underestimate the value and importance of children. Jesus didn’t and here at the Olive Tree Kids Church, we most certainly don’t either.

        <h3>Olive Tree Prayer Team</h3>
        <p>
          A team of like-minded, committed people who have a heart to meet the prayer needs of the Olive Tree Church family. The prayer team invites and encourages others to share their prayer needs, and as a group offers prayers of praise, petition and thanksgiving
          to God. A safe place for people to share their concerns, joys and heartaches, knowing that many are praying and uplifting them on their behalf. Prayer needs are promptly sent out to the team by email and we have regular prayer meeting where
          we join together with coffee, with God and pray. Personal prayer requests can be submitted here
        </p>
        <h3>Olive Tree Worship</h3>
        <p>
          A God as good, gracious and loving as the God we serve deserves to be worshipped with all our heart, soul, mind and strength. Of course the question of how exactly this should be done is highly subjective and probably as old as church itself. The ethos
          of the Olive Tree of keeping things simple and bringing things back to first principle extends to how we choose to worship God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bible says that we should worship Him in spirit and in truth. How exactly do we do that? Like most churches we recognise the power and the influence of music in our culture and this is a key medium through which we express our adoration to God (while
          also recognising that true worship encompasses so many more areas of our life). That said we do not have a particular sound or way in which we would like to worship God. We start again with the proverbial blank sheet of paper and begin to explore
          what it means to worship and how we can express ourselves creatively to God. There are so many ways this can be done whether that is through traditional worship songs sung by the congregation, by video clips or items; by a large group of musicians
          or just one or two.
        </p>
        <p>
          The point is not what it looks like, but the heart that is offered up to God and the spirit in which it is done: to worship God in spirit and in truth.
